Description
===========

When a viewer buys a ticket, they are automatically added to your Hidden Cam show. Moderators can add users to the show manually to cover special circumstances. By default, ticket holders will have highlighted text in chat so you can easily identify them.

The broadcaster should not deactivate CrazyTicket immediately after starting the show. If the app is deactivated, the ticket holder list will be lost.
